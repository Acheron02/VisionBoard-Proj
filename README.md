# VisionBoard: Defect Detection and Classification System Using Image Processing for Educational PCB Inspection Repository

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the source code, configuration files, and documentation for an **VisionBoard: Defect Detection and Classification System Using Image Processing for Educational PCB Inspection** developed as part of a computer engineering electives project. The system is designed to automatically detect PCB defects and recognize electronic components using image processing and deep learning techniques.

Due to file size limitations, large datasets and trained model weights are hosted externally and are **not included directly** in this repository.
